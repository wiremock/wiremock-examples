# Using Wiremock as Testcontainers Proxy

### 1. Overview
In this tutorial, we'll use WireMock and Testcontainers to test the integration between two Spring Boot applications. Firstly, we'll use Testcontainers' _DockerComposeContainer_ to spin up a Docker container with a service exposing a REST API. 

**Then, we'll use WireMock to proxy this service, injecting delays or faults for specific requests.** This will allow us to validate the contract between the services and ensure the client application handles unexpected responses correctly.

### 2. Setting Up _DockerComposeContainer_

 Let's start by importing the [_testcontainers_](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testcontainers/testcontainers) dependency, and the [_junit-jupiter_](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testcontainers/junit-jupiter) extension:
<details>
<summary>Gradle</summary>

```gradle
testImplementation "org.testcontainers:testcontainers:${testcontainersVersion}"
testImplementation "org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter:${testcontainersVersion}"
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Maven</summary>

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>
  <artifactId>testcontainers</artifactId>
  <version>${testcontainers.version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
  <version>${testcontainers.version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
</details>

Now, let's use _DockerComposeContainer_ to launch a Docker container based on a Docker Compose file. The service will expose a REST API, allowing us to wait for a specific endpoint to return a "200" status code to confirm that the container is ready to accept traffic.

```java
@Testcontainers
class IntegrationTest {

  @Container
  static DockerComposeContainer<?> env = new DockerComposeContainer<>(
          new File("src/test/resources/compose-test.yml"))
      .withExposedService("conversion-rates-api", 8080, 
          Wait.forHttp("/currencies").forStatusCode(200))
      .withLocalCompose(true);
  
}
```

### 3. Testing the Ideal Scenario

With this configuration, Testcontainers will start the container and bind its 8080 port to a random port one form our machine. So, in order to write our first test, we only need to find out the port where the REST API is exposed:
```java
static String testcontainerUrl() {
  return "http://localhost:" + env.getServicePort("conversion-rates-api", 8080);
}
```
Now, let's use this _URL_ to when creating the tested class, and validate the positive outcome:

```java
@Test
void shouldReturnOkForTheHappyFlow() {
  var exchange = new ExchangeCalculator(testcontainersUrl());
  
  var response = exchange.toEuro(100.00, "USD");

  assertThat(exchange.toEuro(100.00, "USD"))
    .extracting(ResponseEntity::getStatusCode, ResponseEntity::getBody)
    .containsExactly(HttpStatus.OK, "Exchanging 100.0 USD at a rate of 0.92 will give you 92.0 EUR");
}
```
As we can see, Testcontainers' DockerComposeContainer enables us to test the _ExchangeCalculator_ class and  verify the interaction between our services.

### 4. Using WireMock as a Proxy

We have successfully tested the client's happy flow. However, it's crucial to test various scenarios, including network failures, latency, and timeouts.

To accomplish this, we can use [_wiremock-standalone_](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.wiremock/wiremock-standalone) and configure it as a proxy. Let's add this dependency to our project:
<details>
<summary>Gradle</summary>

```gradle
testImplementation "org.wiremock:wiremock-standalone:${wiremockVersion}"
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Maven</summary>

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wiremock</groupId>
  <artifactId>wiremock-standalone</artifactId>
  <version>${wiremock.version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
</details>

Now, let's add the _@WireMockTest_ extension and configure it to start the WireMock server on a specified port:

```java
@Testcontainers
@WireMockTest(httpPort = IntegrationTest.WIREMOCK_PORT)
class IntegrationTest {

  static final int WIREMOCK_PORT = 1234;

  // ...
}
```
Next, we'll update our test by instantiating the _ExchangeCalculator_ object with the WireMock URL. **We'll also configure WireMock to stub the requests for fetching currencies and proxy the calls to the underlying service provided through Testcontainers**:
```java
ExchangeCalculator exchange = new ExchangeCalculator("http://localhost:" + WIREMOCK_PORT);

@Test
void shouldReturnOkForTheHappyFlow() {
  stubFor(get(urlMatching("/currencies/.*"))
    .willReturn(aResponse()
      .proxiedFrom(testcontainerUrl())));

  var response = exchange.toEuro(100.00, "USD");

  assertThat(response)
    .extracting(ResponseEntity::getStatusCode, ResponseEntity::getBody)
    .containsExactly(HttpStatus.OK, "Exchanging 100.0 USD at a rate of 0.92 will give you 92.0 EUR");
}
```

### 5. Injecting Failures and Delays

**The advantage of this setup is that we can use the proxy to inject failures and artificial delays into the proxied server's responses.**

For instance, we can deliberately return an incorrect response for a specific currency. Let's set up a test to redirect all API calls, except for those requesting the conversion rate for "GBP":

```java
@Test
void shouldReturnServerErrorWhenRequestFails() {
  stubFor(get(urlMatching("/currencies/.*"))
    .willReturn(aResponse()
      .proxiedFrom(testcontainerUrl())));
  
  stubFor(get(urlMatching("/currencies/GBP"))
    .willReturn(aResponse()
      .withBody("Wrong response, definitely not a valid response!")));

  var nokResponse = exchange.toEuro(100.00, "GBP");

  assertThat(nokResponse)
      .extracting(ResponseEntity::getStatusCode, ResponseEntity::getBody)
      .containsExactly(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "Ooops! There was an error oun our side!");
}
```

Additionally, let's add a test to ensure the client application times out if the response takes longer than two seconds. We can achieve this by introducing a three-second delay before returning the proxied answer:

```java
@Test
void shouldReturnGatewayTimeoutWhenRequestIsTooSlow() {
  stubFor(get(urlMatching("/currencies/.*"))
    .willReturn(aResponse()
      .proxiedFrom(testcontainerUrl())));

  stubFor(get(urlMatching("/currencies/RON"))
    .willReturn(aResponse()
      .withFixedDelay(3_000)
      .proxiedFrom(testcontainerUrl())));

  var slowResponse = exchange.toEuro(100.00, "RON");

  assertThat(slowResponse.getStatusCode())
      .isEqualTo(HttpStatus.GATEWAY_TIMEOUT);
}
```

### 6. Conclusion

In this example, we learned how to use Testcontainers to spin up containers from a Docker Compose file and integrate them into our tests. We then used WireMock to proxy the calls to these containers, allowing us to inject failures and artificial delays. This enabled us to test a wide variety of scenarios.
